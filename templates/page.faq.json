            "answer": "<p>High Poly and Low Poly models differ primarily in their polygon count and compatible software\/formats, which directly impacts the level of detail and computational requirements.<\/p><p><\/p><ul><li>High Poly models at Globe Plants contain a large number of polygons, resulting in a higher level of detail. This makes them ideal for high-resolution renders or close-up views where every leaf and branch detail can contribute to the overall realism. However, these models are more computationally intensive and may require more advanced hardware for smooth rendering<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><ul><li>On the other hand, Low Poly models have a reduced polygon count, which makes them less detailed but also less demanding on your system. These models are optimized for efficiency\/performance and are ideal for creating larger scenes, backgrounds, real time rendering or when working on hardware with limited processing power. They allow for faster rendering times while still providing a visually pleasing representation of each 3D plant model.<\/li><\/ul>",

The process of creating each type of model is distinct and requires separate workflows.<\/p><p>Creating a high poly model involves a detailed process to ensure the highest level of realism and detail. The creation of low poly models, while they may appear simpler, is actually a more complex and time-consuming process. It requires careful optimization of each geometries and materials to ensure the model maintains a visually pleasing appearance while having a reduced polygon count for efficiency.<\/p><p>Given the unique processes and the extensive work involved in creating each type of model, we treat high poly and low poly models as separate products. It would be unfair to our team of dedicated artists and to the value of their work to offer two distinct products for the price of one.<\/p><p>We encourage you to choose the model type that best suits your project needs and resources.
